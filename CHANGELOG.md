## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-07

A minor release focused on iteration: live-data dashboards graduate to a first-class artifact category, an in-preview Inspect mode lands for per-element style tuning, the desktop launcher gets an accent color theme, Critique Theater advances to Phase 5, and Linux gains headless lifecycle support. New Qoder CLI agent, Nano Banana image provider, and Indonesian locale. 51 merged PRs since 0.4.1, accumulated across 16 beta cycles.

### Added

#### Web / UI
- **Inspect mode** — live per-element style tuning in the HTML preview. ([#362])
- **Accent color control + launcher** — a global accent persists across the desktop launcher and entry view. ([#683])
- **Connection tests for execution settings** — verify provider config without launching a chat. ([#507])
- Replaced the SketchEditor `window.prompt()` text tool with an in-app modal so long prompts stop getting clipped. ([#738])

#### Media generation
- **Nano Banana image provider.** ([#631])
- HyperFrames video previews, provider badge, and source filter on the templates surface. ([#293])

- Migrated beta release publishing to R2. ([#805])

#### Internationalization
- **Indonesian (`id`) UI locale.** ([#414])

### Changed

- Extended OpenAI image request timeouts so larger generations stop being killed mid-flight. ([#788])
- Surfaced the `@nexudotio` X account in README and entry sidebar. ([#696])

### Fixed

#### Daemon and agents
- Delivered Copilot prompts via stdin to avoid Windows `ENAMETOOLONG`. ([#727])

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-06

0.4.1 is the startup hotfix for the broken 0.4.0 desktop packages. It restores packaged app startup on macOS and Windows, adds release validation so the failure mode is caught before publication, and includes the small UI, agent, documentation, i18n, and craft updates that landed while the hotfix was being verified.

### Added

#### Web / UI
- **Manual edit mode** for direct artifact edits. ([#620])
- **Cmd/Ctrl+P quick file switcher** for faster project navigation. ([#556])

### Changed

- Updated README first-PR links so `help-wanted` issues are surfaced alongside `good-first-issue`. ([#605])

### Fixed

#### Packaging
- Fixed packaged desktop startup by building `@open-design/contracts` to `dist/*.mjs` + `.d.ts`, pointing its exports at compiled JavaScript, and building contracts before all packaged lanes pack workspace tarballs. ([#577])
- Added packaged runtime beta gating so release candidates install, start, inspect `/api/health`, collect logs, stop, and uninstall before promotion. ([#637])

#### Daemon and agents
- Added the required stdio MCP server env field and recover from `-32602` on `session/set_model`. ([#627])

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-05

A multi-protocol leap: Open Design now ships as an MCP server, ships Critique Theater (Design Jury) Phase 4, gains live-reload + Tweaks mode + live artifacts in the preview pane, and adds five new agent / runtime adapters. 71 merged PRs from 40+ contributors over two days. Linux AppImage packaging landed in tooling, but the stable Linux artifact is deferred from 0.4.0 while containerized release packaging is hardened.

### Added

#### MCP & agent integration
- **`od mcp` — expose Open Design as a stdio MCP server.** Coding agents in other repos (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Antigravity, Zed, Windsurf) can read files from local Open Design projects directly, including the project the user has open in the Open Design app right now. ([#399])
- **Link code folder support for agent context** — point agents at any local code folder alongside the design project. ([#455])
- Kilo CLI (ACP) agent adapter. ([#480])
- DeepSeek TUI agent adapter. ([#439])

#### Critique workflow
- **Critique Theater Phase 4** — persistence, transcript, and orchestrator. The "Design Jury" multi-panelist scoring pipeline is now end-to-end. ([#481])
- Critique Theater foundation — shared contracts and streaming v1 parser (Phases 0–2). ([#387])

#### Preview pane
- **Live-reload preview iframes** when project files change on disk. ([#409])

- URL-load HTML preview iframes by default (`?forceInline=1` opt-out). ([#384])
- **Live artifacts and Composio connector catalog.** ([#381])

#### Packaging & deployment

#### Daemon
- `OD_MEDIA_CONFIG_DIR` to relocate `media-config.json` (Nix store, immutable images, sandboxes). ([#411])
